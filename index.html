        <h1>Human Activity Recognition</h1><br>
    
    <p>To check out the published paper, click <a href="https://www.inderscience.com/info/inarticle.php?artid=136697">here!</a></p>

    <h2>Dataset and Experiment Setup</h2>
    <p>This project focused on human activity recognition using wireless signal characteristics, specifically the Channel State Information (CSI) data. The dataset used in the experiment consisted of CSI values corresponding to six activities: walking, jumping, falling, doing nothing, clapping, and waving. The experimental setup involved a transmitter and receiver placed 250 meters apart in a line of sight configuration. The CSI data underwent preprocessing, including reformatting the matrix and truncating it to ensure uniformity across all samples.</p>

    <h2>Model Training and Performance Assessment</h2>
    <p>Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Squeezenet models were trained using the preprocessed CSI data for activity classification. Performance evaluation was conducted using metrics such as F1 score, true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the CNN and Squeezenet models in accurately classifying human activities based on the CSI data. However, the limitations of the project included a limited activity set, a relatively small dataset, and a line of sight configuration.</p>

    <h2>Effective Recognition with CNN and Squeezenet</h2>
    <p>The CNN and Squeezenet models effectively extracted meaningful features from the input data, capturing essential patterns and representations. The subsequent fusion of these features through concatenation allowed the SVM to make highly accurate predictions. The achieved validation accuracy of 98.80% demonstrates the successful integration and synergy between deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches. This project highlights the potential for combining multiple models and techniques to enhance classification performance, particularly when dealing with complex datasets.</p>

    <div class="paragraph-with-image1">
        The process begins by extracting raw CSI data from the dataset. This raw data is then pre-processed to ensure optimal training results. The pre-processing step involves techniques such as reformatting, truncating, data augmentation etc. After pre-processing, the data is divided into training data and validation data. Typically, an 80/20 split is used. The training dataset is further divided into training data and testing data. A 90/10 split is used. The training data is used to train the CNN and SqueezeNet model individually, and the testing data is used for evaluating their performance. Both the CNN and SqueezeNet models extract features from the training data. These features are then concatenated, combining the strengths of both models. The concatenated data is used to train an SVM classifier or a Support Vector Machine classifier.</p>
        <img src="nit proj 1.PNG" width="500px">
    </div>

    <p>The classifier (SVM), now trained, utilizes the combined features to classify the validation data. By leveraging the learned patterns and relationships in the concatenated feature data, the SVM classifier can accurately predict the corresponding gestures or activities. Overall, this process involves data extraction, pre-processing, data splitting, individual training of CNN and SqueezeNet models, feature concatenation, SVM training, and finally, the classification of new data using the trained SVM classifier.</p>

    <h2>Promising Future Directions</h2>
    <p>While the project yields exciting results, there's an array of avenues for future exploration. Expanding the activity set, amassing a more expansive and diverse dataset, exploring other wireless signal characteristics, incorporating multi-modal data, and implementing the models in real-time systems are all potential enhancements. These endeavors would contribute to the advancement of non-intrusive and cost-effective approaches to human activity recognition, with applications in surveillance, healthcare, and smart environments.</p>

    <h2>A Seamless Fusion of Innovation</h2>
    <p>The results of this project also contribute to the understanding and development of robust classification systems, where deep learning models can be effectively combined with traditional machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy and provide more reliable predictions. This project showcases the potential of using wireless signal characteristics, specifically CSI data, for human activity recognition. The findings offer valuable insights into creating more perceptive environments, while maintaining data integrity and security.</p>
